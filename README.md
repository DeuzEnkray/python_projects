# Python Projects
<p>A collection of Python projects I have made till now on my journey of learning python.</p>
<p>I haven't dipped my hands in anything fancy yet. My projects till now include basic data structures, algorithms, and a graphic calculator. I plan to delve into PyGames, NumPy and Pandas while polishing my Tkinter skills</p>

<h1>Tkinter Projects</h1>
<p>All projects I made using Tkinter (currently one). I haven't given enough time to Tkinter yet, as I am currently focused on data structures, algorithms, and machine learning</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calculator</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Calculator</th>
    <td>Riddled with bugs at the moment as it cannot deal with negative numbers. Since I made it as a complete beginner to tkinter, it's very lackluster.</td>
  </tr>

<p>All data structures I have made till now.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linked List</li>
  <li>Stack (Linked List Implementation)</li>
  <li>Queue (Linked List Implementation)</li>
  <li>Hashing with Linear Probing</li>
  <li>Hashing with Chaining</li>
</ul>
<h1>Algorithms</h1>
<p>All algorithms I have made till now. Comprises of mostly sorting algortihms</p>
<ul>
  <li>Binary Search</li>
  <li>Bubble Sort</li>
  <li>Selection Sort</li>
